    <p>Viskefi Studios manages Render farm and Artist's workstations for the daily renders.</p>
    <p>Render farm hosts will be used 24/7 once available at the premises.</p>
    <p>User workstations will be used for overnight renders.</p>

    <h2>Support from Production Team:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The prod team should inform if any user is on leave and provide their workstation for daytime renders.</li>
        <li>The prod team should inform Artists to log out daily so that the workstations will have more Procs &amp; RAM to utilize for the overnight renders or jobs that get errors.</li>
        <li>Artists should inform the Prod team or Render team through the Mattermost ‘Rendering’ channel about not using their workstations for certain time frame or the whole night if FX Caching or Light/Comp renders are happening.</li>
        <li>Artists should save their data before leaving for the day, as Render team will log out/Reboot forcefully for the overnight render utilizations.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="status">IN PROGRESS...</p>
